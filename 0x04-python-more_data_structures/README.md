## 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
#### Sets
A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements

Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets. Note: to create
an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an empty
dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section.

#### Dictionary
A disctionary is indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type;
strings and numbers can always be keys.

It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the
requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces
creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of
key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary
